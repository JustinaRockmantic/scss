      <h1>MEOWY CHRISTMAS</h1>
      <p>
        'Twas the week before Christmas when all thro' the house, not a creature
        was stirring, not even a mouse. (Because, you know . . . cats).
        <br />
        <br />
        The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, and the cats were
        trying to pull them down from there.
        <br />
        <br />
        Out on the lawn, I heard such a clatter, I flew to the window to see
        what was the matter. (I figured it was stray cats, they're always into
        something.)
        <br />
        <br />
        When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh,
        and 8 tiny reindeer. (But not too tiny, because, you know . . . cats.)
        <br />
        <br />
        And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof . . . nothing. Because it
        was Santa Claws, and you know . . . cats. They're pretty stealthy.

      <p>
        As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney Santa
        Claws came with a bound.
        <br />
        <br />
        He was dressed all in fur, from his ears to his foot, and right away
        started grooming, (because of the soot.)
        <br />
        <br />
        He spoke not a word, but went (rather lazily) to his work, and filled
        all the stockings,then turned with jerk
        <br />
        <br />
        because he heard a bell that had chimed, and straight up the Christmas
        tree he climbed!
        <br />
        <br />
        But I heard him meow, as I set the tree back upright,
        <br />
        <br />
